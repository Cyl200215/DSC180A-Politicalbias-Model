"“When you compare us to the European Union, we're something like 23 times more likely” to have homicides and handgun killings.",mostly-true,"The U.S. firearm homicide rate in 2019 was 4.11 people per 100,000, compared with 0.19 in the 27-nation European Union, according to research by the University of Washington.In other words, firearm homicides were 22 times more frequent in the U.S. than in the EU."
“An overwhelming majority of Wisconsinites support restoring #Roe and legalizing marijuana.”,mostly-true,"In the most recent Marquette Law Poll, 55% of respondents said they opposed the reversal of the landmark abortion law Roe v. Wade.Also in a recent poll, 64% of respondents said they want marijuana to be legalized in Wisconsin.Earlier polls from this year showed peaks of 63% of respondents opposing Roe’s reversal and 69% of respondents wanting marijuana legalized.Those are clear majorities, though Evers stretches the statement a bit by claiming that both majorities are “overwhelming.”"
Herschel Walker “wants a nationwide ban on abortion” and said no exceptions “not even for rape or incest or life of the mother.”,mostly-true,"For most of his Senate campaign, Georgia Republican Herschel Walker has supported a national ban on abortion. He’s also said there shouldn’t be exceptions for rape, incest or life of the mother.Walker’s stance hasn’t been consistent. Late in his campaign, Walker said he supported two measures that included exceptions — a 2019 Georgia law and a proposal by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.Walker has also said abortion rules should be decided at the state level, while supporting a nationwide ban."
"""If Arizona were a country, it’d be the eighth largest incarcerator in the world.""",mostly-true,"The Prison Policy Initiative reported, based on data from 2020 and 2021, that Arizona would have the eighth highest incarceration rate in the world if it were evaluated as an independent nation. The state incarcerates 868 people per 100,000 residents. Other measures also rank Arizona high for incarceration rates.Other agencies measure incarceration rates across different times and with different methodologies. Therefore, finding any one definitive number is difficult."
"Sen. Marco Rubio ""helped write the law to raise prescription prices.""",mostly-true,"Rubio did not write ""the law"" to raise prescription prices. He introduced a bill to repeal provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act that are intended to reduce Medicare drug prices. But the U.S. Senate did not vote on it, and it is not a law.Experts said the Inflation Reduction Act would lower the cost of drugs for Medicare recipients, and Rubio's efforts to repeal the Medicare drug provisions would raise prices.Rubio's bill is aimed at encouraging manufacturers to develop new drugs by allowing them to raise prices and collect higher profits. It targets provisions that will primarily affect drug prices for Medicare enrollees and affect drug prices for nonenrollees only modestly."
"The state is absorbing the cost of overtime pay for farmworkers, and farm owners do not have to pay any more.",mostly-true,"The state is gradually lowering the threshold for overtime pay for farmworkers, and is offering refundable tax credits to cover the cost as the threshold falls below 60 hours per week. The threshold will reach 40 hours in 2032.Overtime pay for work beyond 60 hours per week is the responsibility of the farm owner.The tax credits are included in the state budget. They are not designed to end, but a future legislature could eliminate them."
Katie Hobbs “has voted to double our gas tax.”,mostly-true,"Katie Hobbs co-sponsored a bill in 2018 to raise gas taxes from 18 cents per gallon to 36 cents per gallon. The measure never received a vote by the full Senate.Arizona’s gas tax has remained at 18 cents per gallon since it was set in 1990.Without increases, the gasoline tax revenue’s capacity to maintain roads and bridges erodes with inflation."
"Says ""Ron Johnson is making excuses for rioters who tried to overthrow our government, even calling them ‘peaceful protests.’”",mostly-true,"Johnson in various forums has blamed “leftists posing as Trump supporters” for starting the riot, though based on Justice Department charges there has been no sign that was the case.He has also routinely minimized what happened, claiming it was not an armed insurrection – something we have rated Pants on Fire.But the ad ignores past statements where Johnson has been more explicit in specifically condemning those who broke the law."
“One in six local election officials have received threats of violence” and threats against judges have doubled over four years and threats against members of Congress have increased by 10 times over five years.,mostly-true,"A survey done early in 2022 on behalf of the Brennan Center found that 1 in 6 local election officials experienced threats.A 2021 report by the U.S. Marshals Service showed that the number of threats against the judiciary or other federal court officials that resulted in investigations rose from 363 in 2017 to 1,343 in 2021.Threats against members of Congress rose from 902 in 2016 to 9,625 in 2021."

“Carol Miller is a multi-millionaire worth over $16 million.”,mostly-true,"• The midpoint estimate for Miller’s net worth, a standard calculation for situations like this, was $16 million in 2018 and was about the same for 2021.• But because members of Congress report personal financial data in ranges, there’s no way to know whether her net worth was higher or lower than that figure."
"If a 12-year-old girl became pregnant because of rape or incest, ""Tim Michels would force her to deliver the baby.""",mostly-true,"Michels has long opposed the idea of adding exceptions for rape and incest into Wisconsin’s ban on abortion, even saying on a 2004 WPR radio show that although a 12-year-old becoming pregnant because of rape would be the worst kind of crime, he would encourage her to deliver the baby so it could be adopted. (His team has pointed out that the comment is nearly 20 years old.)He opposed such exceptions in his current gubernatorial campaign as well. In several instances up through September 2022, he reiterated that he does not support them.In late September, he said he would sign a bill creating such exceptions if he saw one come across his desk as governor. But his campaign maintained that his personal beliefs on the subject hadn’t changed."
"""When I was your governor, we reduced insurance rates by 10%.""",mostly-true,"Statewide, homeowners' insurance premiums declined 10% from 2007 to 2010, Charlie Crist's first and last full year as governor.

“Black women are 3 to 4 times more likely to die (from maternal mortality) even when they have the insurance and the income.”,mostly-true,"• Studies have shown Black-white disparities for maternal mortality similar to what Sen. Raphael Warnock said, but they did not control for income or insurance status.• A 2019 study found that for women who had attended college or earned a college degree — which often correlates with higher income and being covered by health insurance — the Black-white differential ranged from 3.5 to 5.2 times, which would be in line with what Warnock said."
Kari Lake has “gone on the record saying she supports Arizona's complete abortion ban. She's called it a great law.”,mostly-true,"An Arizona law dating back to when the state was still a territory bans nearly all abortions, except to save the mother’s life.The end of Roe v. Wade opened the door to reactivating the law.The Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake applauded the law."

It’s also unclear whether the recent spike in fentanyl seizures reflects an increased inflow or improved interdiction by law enforcement."
"“There have now been 16 straight months of OVER 150,000 illegal border crossings.”",mostly-true,"• Customs and Border Protection data shows that the number of southwest border encounters has exceeded 150,000 per month for 18 consecutive months.• The data does not show that more than 150,000 people crossed the border illegally each month, because the data tracks events, not people. The same person might cross the border and be encountered by law enforcement more than once.• Not all people who crossed the border were allowed into the United States. Some were expelled under a public health order intended to stop COVID-19 from spreading."
Sen. Marco Rubio and U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis “voted against aid for Hurricane Sandy.”,mostly-true,"Sen. Marco Rubio and Gov. Ron DeSantis have sought assistance from the Biden administration for disaster relief in Florida following Hurricane Ian.In 2012 and 2013, Rubio voted against the larger aid packages for victims of Hurricane Sandy but supported smaller aid bills.

"Says Ron Johnson ""wants to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every single year.""",mostly-true,"In August, Johnson suggested in a radio show interview that all federal spending should be discretionary, meaning it’s reviewed annually by Congress, and if it’s not reapproved, it ends.In response to the Democratic argument that he wants to open up Social Security and Medicare to cuts, Johnson has said he doesn’t want to cut the programs; instead, he floated the idea to ensure they remain financially solvent.Still, putting them up for annual review opens up the possibility of a yearly battle, meaning they could be cut or reduced."
"Says under his plan to end cash bail ""the Waukesha perpetrator wouldn’t have been released """,mostly-true,"The proposed statute did give a judge discretion while also requiring that additional evidence, beyond the “nature, number, and gravity of the offenses” be presented before a judge can deny someone release.Under the current system, cash bail is meant to ensure a defendant shows up at trial. It’s not meant to keep the defendant in jail. So, once bail is posted, he or she can go free.It’s possible Brooks might not have been released, but there is no guarantee of that."
"Every time a Republican has been elected president over the last few decades, House Democrats have objected to the result",mostly-true,"Democrats made objections to election results during election certifications in 2001, 2005 and 2017.In all three of those years, the losing candidate had already conceded the race.In 2021, 147 Republicans objected to the results, and Trump was actively trying to stay in office."

They said he did not have a weapon and released him without filing any charges."
Blake Masters “wants to pass a national ban on abortion.”,mostly-true,"During the primary campaign, Arizona U.S. Senate candidate Blake Masters backed a so-called federal personhood law, which is usually viewed as a national ban on abortion because it argues that abortion violates a fetus’s constitutional rights.Masters was vague about at what stage of pregnancy the ban should take effect.After winning the GOP nomination, Masters continued to back a national ban, but he said it should only be for third-trimester abortions."

It found that 54% of Wisconsinites live in a child care desert.An area of the state was labeled a desert if there were more than three children for one licensed child care facility slot in a given U.S. Census tract.But, because of limits on data collection, the research doesn’t account for public school-sponsored day cares and care provided by family, friends and neighbors.Nevertheless, researchers regard the methodology and its findings as reliable and reflective of the child care crisis facing Wisconsin and the United States."

When the law expired, mass shootings tripled.""",mostly-true,"Several studies find that mass shooting deaths fell slightly in the decade of the federal assault weapon ban, and then rose dramatically in the decade that followed.New research suggests that limits on large-capacity magazines play a key role.No strong evidence shows that the ban’s presence or its end caused the change in mass shooting deaths, but many studies find a correlation."

"“Most of these killers tend to be 18, 19 years old.”",mostly-true,"• Murphy is accurate, and even a little understated, in the context of school shootings alone, according to a Washington Post database of school shootings since 1999.• The share of teenagers committing mass shootings overall is significantly smaller.• The term “killers” is not entirely accurate for this statistic, since some of the shootings analyzed by the Post did not result in deaths."
"""Under Greg Abbott, property taxes have gone up $20 billion.""",mostly-true,"O'Rourke's right that estimated revenue collected through local property taxes increased by about $20 billion from 2015, when Gov. Greg Abbott first took office, to 2021.However, the governor's impact on property taxes is indirect because property taxes are set locally in Texas. The governor and state legislature can change the rules on propety taxes and have supported propety tax reform to mitigate the increases in property taxes that's matching rising property values."

Using a standard fatal dose of 2 milligrams, the amount seized in 2021 would have been enough to kill every American 7.64 times over.• The fatal dose could vary depending on body size, past exposure to fentanyl, and purity.

"“While the initial increase in oil prices resulted in a near instantaneous increase in gas prices for consumers, the subsequent decrease in crude oil prices has failed to meaningfully provide relief for Georgia's families at the pump.”",mostly-true,"Gasoline prices cratered during the early months of the pandemic. They later rose when people began to travel and commute again. When Russia invaded Ukraine in February, the global oil market was thrown into disarray, and prices went up.When oil prices rise rapidly, the costs at the pump go up rapidly. When the oil prices decline, the costs at the pump go down more slowly than consumers would like.Economists and energy experts refer to this as the “rockets and feathers” phenomenon – prices go up like a rocket but down like a feather."
"If Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers ""had passed his (gas) tax increases ... fuel prices would be at least a dime higher.",mostly-true,"A proposal from Evers, which was ultimately rejected by Republican lawmakers, would have increased the gas tax by 8-cents per gallon and tied future increases to inflation.A new report shows gas taxes would be 11.1 cents higher today, if it had gone into effectAt the same time, the governor pushed to end the state’s “minimum markup law” on gasoline, which would have cushioned or even offset the blow.But there is debate about whether there would be long-term savings from such a change, since other factors play important roles in pricing."

“Make no mistake: The current spike in gas prices is largely the fault of Vladimir Putin.”,mostly-true,"• The most recent spike in gas prices has stemmed largely from Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. However, gas prices were rising long before the Russian troop buildup around Ukraine became front-page news, primarily from growing demand due to the economic recovery from the pandemic."
"U.S. imports 1% of its oil from Russia while “Exxon, Chevron, BP and Shell profits are at their highest level in over 7 years.”",mostly-true,"U.S. gas prices, which were already on the rise following pandemic-related changes in supply and demand, hit a new price per gallon high March 8 that hasn’t been seen since July 2008.The price increase was partly attributed to the invasion of Ukraine as Western countries imposed economic sanctions on Russia for its aggression.Several major oil companies — Exxon, Chevron, BP and Shell — reported record-breaking profits before the invasion."
"""Here in Wisconsin, prescription drug costs grew at a pace of nearly twice as much as the average Wisconsinite's income from 2015-2019.""",mostly-true,"The average annual cost of prescription drug treatment increased 26.3% between 2015 and 2019, according to the AARP.U.S. Census Bureau data shows the median income for Wisconsin residents went fom$55,638in 2015 to$64,168in 2019, an increase of 15.3%.But the increase for Wisconsin residents age 50 and older increased 13.9%, so Godlewski was generally on target."

Jeff Shipley, R-Birmingham, says public school teachers who teach anything deemed to be divisive sex and racial topics should not receive a pay raise, although the amendment he proposed to do so didn’t pass.Critical Race Theory could not be taught in Iowa public schools because of a 2021 law supported by Republicans banning what the law refers to as divisive topics. State educators say it hasn’t been taught anyway.Democrats in the Iowa House have used their Twitter account to criticize Shipley, saying he only wants Republican versions of history taught in public schools, which he says is a mischaracterization."
“Millions of hardworking Americans will no longer have to worry about unexpected medical bills.”,mostly-true,"President Biden declared there would be no more surprise billing because of a new law, the No Surprises Act, which took effect this year.The act covers many out-of-network medical bills, which can often be very expensive for consumers.But the law doesn’t cover some types of bills and, given the complexity of the nation’s medical system, consumers could still receive large and surprising bills."

Ron DeSantis’) donors.”",half-true,"Ken Griffin, founder and CEO of the Miami-based Citadel hedge fund, influenced the parameters of Florida’s anti-China land law, Bloomberg News reported. Griffin donated to DeSantis’ gubernatorial campaigns, but so far hasn’t donated to DeSantis’ presidential campaign.The 2023 law restricts Chinese citizens from owning or buying land in Florida, stating that they can’t buy property within 10 miles — not 20, as Ramaswamy said — of a military installation or critical infrastructure, which includes places such as airports.To Ramaswamy’s point, the law was loosened to exempt people with nontourist visas, allowing them to buy one residential property as long as it isn’t within 5 miles of military installations, such as bases, posts or camps."
Republicans in Congress are “trying to wipe out federal funding to end the HIV epidemic.”,half-true,"Spending cuts proposed by a Republican-led House subcommittee would cut millions from HIV-related spending.Advocates report that these cuts result largely from the elimination of the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative, which was instituted during the Trump administration and aimed to reduce new infections by 90% by 2030.These proposed cuts would not entirely eliminate federal HIV spending, but could end targeted work in jurisdictions with high rates of HIV, experts told PolitiFact."
"Gasoline prices are ""up 63%"" under President Joe Biden.",half-true,"Gasoline prices have risen under Biden, but the claim used out-of-date data. By the time of the post, gasoline prices had retreated, making the increase under Biden 48% rather than 63%.Experts say that the rise under Biden was largely independent of his policies.

“Gas prices have skyrocketed since Joe Biden took office and continue to do so everyday.”,half-true,"Although there’s no precise definition of ""skyrocketed,"" it’s clear that gasoline prices have been higher during Joe Biden’s presidency than during Donald Trump’s. This was especially so during the peak in midsummer 2022; prices are significantly lower today.Experts say a president’s ability to shape current gasoline prices is sharply limited. Climbing prices under Biden have more to do with increasing economic activity after the COVID-19 pandemic and diplomatic responses to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Learn more aboutPolitiFact’s fact-checking process and rating system."

"""Since the mid-'90s, this country has been governed by revolving continuing resolution and omnibus spending bill(s). … That is the reason we're $33 trillion in debt.""",half-true,"For the better part of three decades, lawmakers have been unable to use 12 ""regular order"" appropriations bills to enact federal spending. Instead, Congress has lurched regularly from temporary bills to massive ""omnibus"" measures.In congressional terminology, a ""continuing resolution"" refers to a short-term spending bill at existing funding levels. An ""omnibus spending bill"" is one that extends most or all of government funding, rather than being passed in 12 separate bills that each cover a limited range of federal departments.Blaming the nation’s debt on the lack of following standard appropriations procedures is an exaggeration. Only about one-quarter of federal spending is approved through the annual appropriations process; about three-quarters of spending runs on autopilot, including entitlements and interest payments."
“We are more energy independent today” under President Joe Biden.,half-true,"In several measurable ways, the U.S. has moved toward energy independence in recent years.Experts say, though, that this hasn’t meant genuine energy independence. The U.S. still depends on international crude oil for key elements of its energy needs, making it sensitive to overseas developments in energy, trade and foreign policy.Energy independence gains under former President Donald Trump’s leadership have strengthened under President Joe Biden."
“Ron DeSantis is against fracking. He is against drilling.”,half-true,"During his 2018 campaign for Florida governor, Ron DeSantis promised to ban fracking and prevent oil drilling off the state’s coast.Also in 2018, voters approved a state constitutional amendment to ban offshore oil and gas drilling.As a presidential candidate, DeSantis says he would ""greenlight oil and gas drilling extraction"" in other states while honoring Florida’s ban."
"U.S. aid to Ukraine will continue during a government shutdown, but programs for food stamps, transportation, education, justice, environmental protection and homelessness will not.",half-true,"The Defense Department said its operations supporting Ukraine in the war with Russia are exempt from a potential federal government shutdown, meaning training of troops and shipments of military equipment will continue.Hundreds of thousands of federal workers in the U.S. may be furloughed, leading to slowdowns of some federal services for Americans.But many essential services, such as law enforcement, air traffic control and food stamps will continue."
"""Texas teacher fired for reading Diary of Anne Frank to class.”",half-true,"A Texas teacher was fired for assigning eighth grade students to read from a graphic illustration adaptation of Anne Frank’s diary, which the district said was not approved.The illustrated edition was written in cooperation with the group founded by Frank’s father, Otto.The book contains references to Frank’s sexuality and description of her genitals, both of which are taken from the published text versions of her diary, in one case word-for-word."
“I taught at the University of Pennsylvania for four years.”,half-true,"President Joe Biden served as a professor of practice at the University of Pennsylvania starting in 2017.

“We know the bank records show that nearly $20 million in payments were directed to the Biden family members and associates through various shell companies.”,half-true,"A convoluted maze of financial records released by House Republicans largely supports House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s claim that Biden family members and associates received almost $20 million in payments from sources with ties to foreign countries.Most of the payments went to Biden family ""associates.""

The bank records show neither evidence that foreign payments went to President Joe Biden nor evidence of wrongdoing by the president.The claim that the payments were funneled through ""shell companies"" is less clear cut. It appears that many of the companies had tangible business and investment purposes, and therefore would not fit what experts said is the commonly used definition of shell companies.Learn more aboutPolitiFact's fact-checking process and rating system."

"“In three short years, we achieved energy independence.”",half-true,"Under then-President Donald Trump, the U.S. became a net energy exporter and began producing more energy than it consumed. Both milestones hadn’t been achieved in decades.However, this didn’t happen ""in three short years,"" as Mike Pence claimed. The achievement built on more than a decade of improvements in shale oil and gas production, as well as renewables. The U.S. also did not achieve net exporter status for crude oil, which produces the type of energy that voters hold politicians most accountable for: gasoline.The United States’ improved record on energy independence does not isolate the country from global developments. Because of how the international market for oil works, the U.S. still imports a substantial amount of oil for domestic use even when it is exporting more oil on net than it imports."
The Trump administration “built nearly 500 miles of border wall.”,half-true,"Trump’s administration built 52 miles of new primary border barriers — the first impediment people encounter if they’re trying to cross the southern border with Mexico, that can block access either for people on foot or for vehicles — where there were none before.The administration built 458 total miles of primary and secondary border barriers, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows. The majority were replacements of smaller, dilapidated barriers.Replacement barriers and secondary barriers that are behind primary barriers don’t add additional miles to the southern border’s total coverage."
"""Wages are up after being adjusted for inflation.""",half-true,Inflation-adjusted wages have increased if you compare today’s level with either pre-pandemic levels — when Joe Biden was not yet president — or with one year ago.But during the entirety of Biden’s presidency — since his January 2021 inauguration  — inflation-adjusted wages have not increased.

Federal “agencies and government have grown 50% since 2019.”,half-true,"•Federal spending is on track to grow 43% to 55% over 2019 levels by 2024, depending on the metric. When adjusted for gross domestic product, the increase is smaller, about 11%.•Spending is an imperfect way to measure the size of ""agencies and government."" Federal employment is up only about 2% since 2019.•About two-thirds of federal spending goes directly to millions of Americans as cash payments or as payments for their health care."
“Young Americans across this country are no longer proud to be American.”,half-true,"Recent polling shows declining numbers of adults of all ages who describe themselves as ""very proud"" to be American.The polling shows that young Americans are consistently less patriotic than older ones, continuing a historical trend."
"“Median income in this country is … $35,000 a year. Because of Joe Biden's inflation, the average monthly expenses have increased by $500, almost.”",half-true,"One measure of median income offers a number close to what Scott said, but it’s not the most commonly used metric. It’s one that moves the median income downward, since it counts children and nonworking spouses in its denominator.The $500 increase in costs because of inflation is based on a June 2022 analysis, when year-over-year inflation was 9.1%. Today, inflation is 4%, which suggests that the cost increase in recent months would be lower."
"""Twenty-six out of every 100 students” in K-12 speak Spanish.",half-true,"A Pew Research Center expert told PolitiFact that 26% of K-12 students are Hispanic, but that doesn’t mean they all speak Spanish.The U.S. Census Bureau’s 2021 American Community Survey shows that 15% of K-12 students speak Spanish at home. It’s unclear what additional percentage speak Spanish, but not at home.In some states with high Hispanic populations — such as California and Texas — more than 26% of K-12 students speak Spanish at home, according to census data."
“The White House Gift Shop is putting out a commemorative coin for Donald Trump's indictment.”,half-true,"A privately owned online gift shop named the ""White House Gift Shop"" is accepting pre-orders for a coin commemorating former President Donald Trump’s second indictment.The gift shop is not affiliated with the Biden administration or the White House, despite its name.The gift shop’s name has fueled misleading claims before."
"“A place like California, they give (immigrants in the country illegally) benefits. They give unemployment checks.”",half-true,"California provides some benefits to people in the country illegally, such as in-state tuition for college and certain health benefits.California residents who are in the U.S. illegally are not eligible for unemployment benefits.

“The share of working-age men choosing to work is the lowest it has ever been.”,half-true,"• The overall trend line for men’s participation in the labor force has fallen consistently since the end of World War II. If you focus specifically on the term Scott used — ""working-age men,"" which filters out retiring baby boomers, who are now ages 59 to 77 — there has still been a decline, but it’s less sharp.• However, the participation rate for working-age men — defined by the government as 25 to 54 — has been rising fairly consistently since the worst of the pandemic in 2020.• Except for the pandemic period, the rate for working-age men has been largely steady for the past dozen years."
"""We pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, in some cases 10 times more than the people of any other country.""",half-true,"Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has for years argued that prescription drug prices in the United States are too high and claimed in this interview that the prices Americans pay are sometimes 10 times what people in other countries pay.Studies we examined generally found that U.S. prices were approximately two to four times higher than those in other countries, not 10.Insulin prices seem to be an exception. In some studies, insulin prices in the United States were at least 10 times those in other countries."
“In Congress Ron DeSantis pushed a 23% national sales tax.”,half-true,"While in Congress, DeSantis was one of multiple co-sponsors of the Fair Tax Act in 2013, 2015 and 2017.The Fair Tax Act would add a national sales tax in lieu of other federal taxes including income tax.

Four North Carolina Republicans made “campaign promises” to protect reproductive rights,half-true,"North Carolina Republicans hope to ban most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy, instead of the current 20 weeks, and will need to override Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's veto for their plan to become law.Three of the Republicans that Cooper singled out did say they planned to support the status quo or, in one case, expand abortion access.But state Sen. Michael Lee said in a September op-ed that he would support banning abortion after the first trimester."
Sen. Tommy Tuberville is preventing military promotions “because he objects to women within the military getting access to reproductive care.”,half-true,"• Tuberville’s procedural blockage targets a new Pentagon policy that allows service members up to 21 days of leave to obtain an abortion or fertility treatments, with reimbursement for travel costs.• However, Schumer’s description of Tuberville’s intent is overly broad. Tuberville’s holdup of nominations is not intended to block service members from getting an abortion if they are stationed in states where abortion is legal, and it is not intended to block ""reproductive care"" beyond abortion, such as pregnancy care."
There is “$500 billion of unspent COVID money” that can be rescinded.,half-true,"Government estimates show that more than $400 billion in COVID-19 relief money remained unspent as of Jan. 31. But government sources say a majority of that money has been allocated, meaning it’s earmarked to be spent and wouldn’t be eligible for rescission.Estimates about how much remains unspent and unallocated range from $70 billion to $90.5 billion."
“Individuals released from incarceration are 129 times more likely to die of a drug overdose during the first two weeks after release.”,half-true,"• One study did find the ratio Tonko cited, but that research has limitations, especially the age of its data, which is more than two decades old.• A more recent study found ratios that were lower: from 40 to 74 times higher.• Regardless of the precise ratio, both studies show a significantly elevated risk of drug overdose for people recently released from incarceration."
"""In the 1960s, liberals emptied our psych wards.""",half-true,"Some of the impetus for moving people with serious mental illness out of institutions in the 1960s came from legislation signed by Democratic presidents and supported by civil rights advocates.But fiscal conservatives, many of them Republicans, also played a crucial role — notably Ronald Reagan, who signed landmark legislation, first as California’s governor and then as president."
“The 5 states with the highest gun homicide rates in the nation all have loose gun laws” while “the 5 states with the lowest rates have some of the toughest laws.”,half-true,"• Data shows some correlation between looser gun laws and higher gun homicide rates in a state, and vice versa.• But that relationship does not always hold true.

"“In the next two years, we'll spend more on interest on our national debt than we do on the national defense.”",half-true,"• A common, apples-to-apples method — the most recent Congressional Budget Office projections, from February 2023 — shows that net interest on the national debt is projected to exceed defense spending starting in fiscal year 2029, but not in the next two years.• It’s possible to envision scenarios that would speed up that date, but doing so would be speculative."
Former President Donald Trump “instructed all the governors to shut down” because of the COVID-19 pandemic.,half-true,"The Trump administration’s written guidelines to slow COVID-19’s spread early in the pandemic called for shutting down schools and for people to avoid going to restaurants except for takeout, and avoid discretionary travel and shopping.Trump’s statements on Twitter and in press conferences were inconsistent about what he said to governors.Sometimes, Trump deferred to governors; other times, he was more forceful about what he thought they should do about shutdowns or reopenings."
"When discussing education savings accounts, ""We would be 31st in the nation to have these policies going forward on behalf of kids.”",half-true,"State Sen. Brandon Creighton, R-Conroe, based his statement on a dashboard by EdChoice, a pro-voucher organization that tracks related legislation.The dashboard included other school choice programs aside from education savings accounts, such as vouchers and tax-credit scholarships.Creighton’s spokesperson said the senator was referring to states more broadly with school choice programs nationwide."
“We have a national debt the size of our nation’s economy for the first time since World War II.”,half-true,"The national debt has been at 100% of gross domestic product since 2013 by one commonly used measure and since 2020 by another measure.Debt exceeded the GDP in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a series of large emergency rescue packages.

"""Businesses large and small have led Texas to be ranked the number one state for business every year that I’ve been governor.""",half-true,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott based the statement on winning the Governor’s Cup, which is awarded by Site Selection, a magazine that specializes in business relocation.Although Texas has won the Governor’s Cup for every year he’s been governor, other sources do not rank Texas as the best state for business, but do have the Lone Star state highly ranked.Experts caution there is no singular ranking."
"Under a GOP bill on cash bail, ""a large quantity of people who are accused of crimes, including anyone who even witnesses certain crimes, could now be detained and subject to bail.""",half-true,"If Wisconsin voters OK a cash bail amendment this April, judges would be able to take into account a wider variety of conditions for setting bail for certain defendants.That includes protecting the community from ""serious harm"" and, if the defendant has been accused of a violent crime, weighing ""the totality of the circumstances"" when deciding to set a cash bail amount. Under current law, a judge can only consider what is needed to ensure the defendant appears in court.Broadening the standard for protecting the community and adding more crimes to a list of violent crimes is likely to result in more people being detained and subject to bail, experts say.But Madison’s point about witnesses misleads, making an example out of ""spectating"" violence that is, in itself, a crime in current state statute."
"Democrats ""want to ban gas powered cars and gas stoves.”",half-true,"One consumer product safety commissioner said in a January interview that a ban on stoves could be considered, but the commission chair rebutted that notion, saying the agency is not seeking a ban.In February, the Energy Department unveiled a proposed rule that would mean that about half of the current gas stove models would not be in compliance. The proposed rule would take effect in 2027, giving manufacturers time to update their models.Some states are banning the sale of new gasoline-powered cars in 2035."

"""Ron DeSantis voted to cut $473 billion from Medicare.""",half-true,"Then-Rep. Ron DeSantis voted for a nonbinding budget resolution in 2017 that recommended reducing projected Medicare spending over the next decade to the tune of $473 billion.The resolution DeSantis voted for is not a law, nor did it immediately impact older Americans’ benefits. Medicare spending would have also grown under the proposal, albeit at a smaller pace."
Gov. Abbott “signed a bill last year eliminating the requirements for Texas schools to teach MLK’s ‘I have a dream’ speech.”,half-true,"Texas Gov. Abbott signed SB 3 in September 2021, which dropped history requirements including the requirement to teach Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speechHowever, the requirement remains in state curriculum standards set by the State Board of Education"
"“Right now, driving 100 miles in an electric vehicle is more expensive than driving an internal combustion engine car.”",half-true,"A report found that for midpriced vehicles, from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, 2022, it was more expensive to charge an electric car than to fuel one with an internal combustion engine. But the comparison did not hold true for luxury vehicles, and the report had a narrow scope that accounted neither for differing costs across the nation for fuel, electricity and taxes nor maintenance and environmental costs."
“We created more new jobs in two years than any president did in their entire term.”,half-true,"• In raw numbers, Biden oversaw greater job growth than any post-World War II president’s first or second term in office.• Measured by percentage increase from the time the presidents took office, Biden rates in the middle of the pack.• Although Biden has easily outpaced every postwar president in job gains per year, he benefited from taking office on the upswing of a deep recession. He also hasn’t faced a recession yet, something most of his predecessors experienced during their longer terms."
"""During my time in office, we've increased per pupil aid by more than $300 per student. Now, our schools have returned to the top 10 in the country after falling to 17 under the previous administration.”",half-true,"By one measure, the increase in aid per student is on the mark – but much of that relied on temporary COVID-relief federal funding.Wisconsin’s ranking in a national survey did improve from No.18 under Walker to No. 8 under Evers.However, those rankings involve a 50-50 mix of performance in higher education and K-12 education — and some of the improvement is due to the higher ed side."
"""(Ron) DeSantis' bill would remove: background checks, instruction, training and oversight.""",half-true,"HB 543 would not eliminate the requirements to get a concealed weapon license in Florida. Those requirements include passing a background check and completing a firearms training class.The bill, however, makes having a license optional, not mandatory.HB 543 will allow people to carry a concealed firearm in public even if they haven’t passed a background check or satisfied all of the license requirements."
“Female student-athletes in Florida need to provide their schools with detailed information about their periods.”,half-true,"An advisory committee for the Florida High School Athletic Association recommended that student-athletes be required to submit information about their periods to their schools. The questions have been included on athletics forms since the early 2000s but are optional.The committee's recommendation has not been implemented. The association’s board of directors is scheduled to vote on it in late February.The proposal has prompted privacy concerns from parents, physicians and abortion- rights advocates. But some sports doctors say the information can help identify disorders that put athletes at greater risk for injury."
"""Under Biden, we have seen over 4.6 million encounters at our southern border. Most have been released into the interior and will stay here indefinitely.""",half-true,"About half of the 4.5 million encounters at the border ended in an immigrant leaving the U.S. At least 2.1 million of them ended in an immigrant being immediately sent back to Mexico or their home country under a public health rule.Another 500,000 immigrants have been detained in the U.S. as they await immigration court hearings.Not all of the immigrants released into the U.S. will stay in the country indefinitely.

"“Two years ago this week, 18 million people were out of work needing unemployment benefits. Today, that number is under 1.6 million, the lowest in decades.”",half-true,"• Biden’s 18 million figure accurately represents the combination of traditional unemployment insurance recipients and those who benefited from temporary programs during the coronavirus pandemic.• The number of unemployment claims today is about 1.6 million, as Biden said.• However, Biden’s two snapshots in time aren’t precisely comparable because the pandemic programs have been phased out. And some people who received benefits in 2021 also didn’t fit the official ""unemployed"" definition."
"“One quarter” of today’s $31.4 trillion federal debt “was accumulated in the four years of my predecessor,” Donald Trump.",half-true,"• Biden’s number is accurate; about one-fourth of the total debt incurred to date came on Trump’s watch.• However, assigning debt to a particular president is tricky, because so much of the spending was approved by decades-old, bipartisan legislation that set the parameters for Social Security and Medicare.• A different calculation shows more debt stemming from former President Barack Obama, with whom Biden served as vice president."
"“Classified documents can never be taken out of a (sensitive compartmented information facility), ever.”",half-true,"There are scenarios in which classified documents can be removed from a sensitive compartmented information facility, also known as a SCIF. It’s a physical space that meets intelligence community protocols that allows officials with the proper security clearance to study classified documents.Sensitive compartmented information facilities are used typically for materials categorized as “top secret/sensitive compartmented information.”There are differing levels of classified documents, with escalating levels of security clearances required to view them. Not all classified documents must be viewed in a SCIF."
"“When the Republicans were in power the last time for eight years, do you know how much discretionary spending increased in those eight years? Zero.”",half-true,"• During the eight-year period Kevin McCarthy’s office cited, the increase in discretionary spending was close to zero when measured by ""outlays,"" or actual federal dollars out the door during a given year.• By a different spending measure known as budget authority — the amount approved for years to come rather than the amount spent in a given year — discretionary spending increased by about 29%.• The first six of the eight years had Democrats in charge of the presidency, the Senate, or both. So, the spending during those six years is not traceable solely to Republicans, but rather to bipartisan negotiations."
“Take-home pay for workers is going up.”,half-true,"• Wages have outpaced inflation for the past two quarters. However, that increase is only beginning to compensate for the wages that were eaten away by inflation earlier in Biden’s presidency.• During Biden’s two years in office, cumulative wage gains have been outpaced by inflation."
"""Florida's water is dirtier and sicker than when Gov. DeSantis first took office.""",half-true,"There is no catch-all unit of measurement to determine whether all of Florida's distinct water bodies are dirtier or sicker.Estuaries and lakes reviewed for impairment in Florida have had increases in pollution since DeSantis took office in 2019. In 2022, Florida ranked first in the U.S. for acres of lakes impaired.That increase was fueled, partly, by a surge in nutrient pollution, which can worsen algae blooms that are toxic for wildlife and cause health complications for people swimming in or drinking from such waters."
Luana Stoltenberg “originally LOST her race for Iowa State House when Machines declared the Democrat the Winner.”,half-true,"The 2022 election winner in Iowa House District 81, which covers northwest Davenport, was declared multiple times, switching hands between the Republican candidate, Luana Stoltenberg, and the Democrat, Craig Cooper.Stoltenberg led by 29 votes in unofficial results Nov. 9. After several administrative recounts and a county canvass certified by the Board of Supervisors, Cooper was declared the winner with a six-vote lead.A bipartisan three-member recount board, hand-picked by the candidates, eventually declared Stoltenberg the victor by 11 votes after Stoltenberg requested a recount of the county canvass results."

“60% of counties in this country are refusing to implement the nation's gun laws.”,half-true,"In 2018, cities and counties started to respond to a wave of state-proposed gun restrictions with Second Amendment sanctuary resolutions.The resolutions vary in wording, but generally state that the jurisdiction supports gun rights. Some resolutions say the county won’t direct funding to enforce laws that leaders feel violate the Second Amendment.The Associated Press found that about 2,000 local jurisdictions have passed such resolutions, which accounts for about 60% of U.S. counties. Although they carry no legal weight, journalists and researchers have found that jurisdictions with these resolutions complied less with “red flag” laws than areas without them."
"Herschel Walker “is heavily funded by the oil and gas industry, raking in more than $140,000 in donations from Big Oil and other energy interests.""",half-true,"Donors from the oil and gas industry gave $190,000 to the campaign of Herschel Walker, the Republican running for U.S. Senate in Georgia.The amount represents less than 1% of $58 million in donations.Groups and people with ties to the oil and gas industry also donated to outside groups, including the Senate Leadership Fund, that have supported Walker."
"“(Raphael) Warnock’s camp was shut down for failing to report five findings of child abuse and neglect.""",half-true,"Maryland state police in 2002 investigated child abuse allegations at a youth summer camp run by a Baltimore church. Raphael Warnock was the church’s pastor, but was not the camp director and was not the subject of the allegations.A Maryland state agency denied the camp an annual operation permit for 2003. It did not cite findings of child abuse in ordering the shutdown.The state cited several regulation violations in denying the permit, including that the camp “did not ensure that child abuse allegations or incidents are reported” as law requires. The camp reopened in 2004 after making corrections."
"“Ted Budd voted to cut Medicare and Social Security and voted to raise the retirement age, too.”",half-true,"The ad cites Budd’s votes on two bills.In 2017, Budd supported a GOP plan that would keep Social Security funds solvent by reducing future benefits and gradually raising the retirement age.In 2021, he voted against a bill that delayed scheduled cuts to Medicare. The bill was paired with legislation that raised the debt ceiling — which is why Budd voted against it."
They were “never my comments” that a woman can’t get pregnant from rape.,half-true,"Congressional candidate Yesli Vega, R-Va., recently denied that she had said ""a woman can't get pregnant from being raped.""Vega, in fact, did not make that comment during a much-publicized interview in spring. To the contrary, she said she was aware of one case where a woman did get pregnant from being raped.But Vega did suggest that women might be less likely to get pregnant from rape “because it's not something that's happening organically. You're forcing it.” Such claims have been disproven by research."
"Abraham Hamadeh says he will “lock up doctors, nurses, pharmacists” and “punish women for abortion.”",half-true,"There are two laws that might hold sway in Arizona — one from 1864 and one from March 2022. The older one threatens abortion providers with jail time; the later one threatens them with fines and loss of their medical license.

Pennsylvania drop boxes were “pre-loaded” with ballots.,half-true,"A small number of people eligible to vote successfully inserted 18 ballots into three of the eight ballot drop boxes in Centre County, Pennsylvania, before the official window of time when the boxes were open to receive ballots.That was possible because of a defect that is now being corrected, the county elections director said. The ballots were secure and could not be extracted by anyone other than election officials.The ballots are not evidence of fraud. The voters simply didn’t follow directions, a county official said."
“Kids are resistant to COVID as opposed to older people.”,half-true,"In Arizona and nationally, children are much less likely than older people to become seriously ill or die from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.The trend for infections is more complicated; at times, the infection rate for children has been lower than for older people.

A Phoenix TV station aired the election results more than a week early.,half-true,A Phoenix television station accidentally aired a graphic that appeared to show it calling the election in favor of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs. The numbers were randomly generated mock election results released by The Associated Press as part of a system test.
Adam Laxalt is “anti-DACA” and “fought against the protections for DACA recipients when he was attorney general.”,half-true,"Adam Laxalt in 2015 sued to stop the Obama administration’s plan to expand a program that prevents the deportation of immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children.That lawsuit didn’t seek to revoke protections for people already in the program, but to restrict how many more people could benefit from it.Laxalt did not join a 2018 lawsuit from other states to end the original program; he said it was because people were already enrolled."
"New York state is outpacing the rest of the country, because shootings in New York are down 10%, and across the country the drop is only 2%.",half-true,"A state report shows a 10% decline in select shooting incidents through August compared to last year in select departments upstate and on Long Island, while more recent New York City report finds a 13.6% decline in shootings.A nationwide database shows a 2% decline, though the database contains more types of shootings than the state report.The nationwide database shows that all shootings in New York state fall by only 3.8%."
“Boston University CREATES a new COVID strain that has an 80% kill rate.”,half-true,"Boston University researchers created a new COVID-19 strain by adding a spike protein from the original omicron variant to the original virus strain.Their goal was studying whether the mutated spike protein from the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 was the reason omicron was more able to evade immunity, but less deadly than earlier COVID strains.The new strain, called Omi-S, killed 80% of infected mice. By comparison, the original strain killed 100% of the mice, while omicron killed none."
"A dog endured “unimaginable pain and suffering” during heart research experiments, “just one of 300 killed in (Dr. Mehmet) Oz’s lab.”",half-true,Dr. Mehmet Oz’s campaign does not dispute a report that more than 300 dogs were euthanized in a heart research lab he supervised.We did not find evidence of widespread pain and suffering among the dogs in the Columbia University lab.The ad’s focus on a dog known as 6313 is misleading. An internal investigation by Columbia said “appropriate veterinary care” was given to this animal.
"Abraham Hamadeh misled ""about his legal experience.”",half-true,Abraham Hamadeh worked as a prosecutor for the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office for almost 3 years.Hamadeh said in an interview that he played a lead role and handled many trials.Court records show he worked on a total of 27 cases.

"Abigail Spanberger supported “nearly $1 billion in stimulus checks for prisoners, including domestic terrorists.”",half-true,"Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., voted for the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021 that authorized $1.9 trillion of economic stimulus in the wake of COVID-19.The bill provided payments of up to $1,400 single taxpayers and $2,800 for joint filers.Republicans denounced the bill, in part because it allowed the payments to go to incarcerated people.But Republicans supported two earlier rounds of stimulus payments in 2020 that allowed stimulus checks to go to imprisoned people."
"The Biden administration has “created” more than double the number of jobs per month, on average, than any other administration going back to George H.W. Bush.",half-true,"• The White House is comparing less than two years under Biden to either four- or eight-year terms for his predecessors. Economists say this puts Biden at an advantage, because most of his predecessors experienced a recession that hampered their job-creation statistics.• Using a different metric — percentage increase in jobs — Biden ranks third among the last six presidents.• The White House’s use of the phrase “jobs created by president” is not entirely warranted, either, since presidential policies are not the only factor that shapes job growth."
“Tim Ryan when he ran for president two years ago … supported banning fracking both on public lands and generally speaking.”,half-true,"• Ryan, as a 2020 presidential candidate, spoke about regulating fracking and even halting it if the industry cannot keep local residents safe. He said he’d “absolutely” consider banning fracking on federal lands and voted to stop the processing of fracking applications for drilling sites off California’s coast.• However, Ryan’s full record of statements and policies show his focus has been on leveraging natural gas as a transitional fuel and a source of revenue and jobs for Ohio, while reducing environmental risks."
"U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio ""has denied climate change.""",half-true,"Sen. Marco Rubio expressed doubt about climate change numerous times before 2018.However, his position shifted after Hurricane Michael struck Florida in 2018, and he has since acknowledged that humans contribute to shifts in temperature and sea levels."
Adam Laxalt “would let Nevada and other states ban abortion with zero exceptions.”,half-true,"Laxalt supported Roe v. Wade's reversal and supports letting states decide what restrictions to put on abortions.In response to the Roe reversal, some states have passed bans with few if any exceptions for the procedure.

Says Mandela Barnes “supported a 20% increase in the gas tax.”,half-true,"The Evers administration did propose an 8-cents-per-gallon gas tax increase in 2019 — and Barnes was part of the administration.But that proposal was accompanied by the planned elimination of the minimum markup for fuel, which could have actually decreased the price at the pump overall."
"Val Demings ""voted to allow transgender youth sports and teaching radical gender identity without parental consent.""",half-true,"Democratic Rep.

This isn’t entirely true. Spending by Democratic legislation including the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 have added some pressure on inflation. However, many economic experts point at external factors for inflationary pressure — such as the war in Ukraine, the lagging effects of COVID-19 and the Federal Reserve’s fiscal policy during COVID-19."
"“In 2016, Democrats suggested that the election was stolen.”",half-true,"Many prominent Democrats say Donald Trump's win in the 2016 presidential election was tainted. But their complaints don't align with Republican claims that the 2020 election, won by Joe Biden, was stolen.Democratic complaints in 2016 focused on events that happened during the campaign: Russian hacking to help Trump and a late October announcement that the FBI had reopened an investigation of Democatic nominee Hillary Clinton.Republican complaints in 2020 centered on disproven claims that Biden won because of a fraudulent vote count.Democrats in 2016 conceded that Trump was legally elected. Many Republicans, including Trump, still contest Biden's victory in 2020."
Ted Budd “helped write legislation to outlaw abortion nationwide with no exceptions for rape or incest — a law that could even put doctors in jail.”,half-true,"The ad refers to a bill known as the “Heartbeat Protection Act of 2021"" and accurately represents its contents.U.S. Rep.

The migrants stayed at a shelter in Edgartown for two nights. They were then offered longer-term accomodations at nearby Cape Cod.There is no legal definition of “sanctuary city” or “sanctuary state.” But the American Immigration Council defines sanctuary policies as those for which ""state and local officials will limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials, but do not actively prevent federal officials from carrying out their immigration enforcement duties."""

"“This year, it's going to be over $1.5 trillion (that we’ve) reduced the debt.""",half-true,"• The Congressional Budget Office’s latest projection shows that the deficit is about $1.7 trillion lower now than it was in 2021.• However, this large decrease is because of an unusual historical circumstance — the expiration of large, temporary programs related to coronavirus pandemic relief.• The federal debt is not lower today than it had been.

"Joe Biden and Raphael Warnock ""are spending $1.5 billion on ‘urban forestry’ and raising taxes on those making under $200k to pay for it.”",half-true,"• The Inflation Reduction Act signed by President Joe Biden includes $1.5 billion to plant more trees and fund related activities, especially in low-income neighborhoods that tend to have fewer trees than wealthier areas.• It is an exaggeration to say the bill will raise taxes on middle- and lower-income Americans. Analyses that reached that conclusion looked only at the tax provisions in the bill and not the spending provisions, which could offset those increases, or surpass them.• Trees can help prevent deaths from heat waves. Trees also can ease carbon levels in the atmosphere."
"“Sixty-four members of Congress — Republicans and Democrats — have broken a law to stop insider stock trading, yet Washington refuses to do anything about it.”",half-true,"More than 70 members of Congress have reportedly violated the STOCK Act, which was enacted to prevent lawmakers from using nonpublic information to get an unfair advantage on the stock market.However, most of the lawmakers listed in article Beasley cited aren’t accused of insider trading — but of reporting their trades late.Her ad also leaves out the fact that lawmakers face fees for filing late.

“The Earth just started spinning faster than ever before and scientists are gravely concerned.”,half-true,"On June 29, 2022, Earth completed a rotation about 1.59 milliseconds faster than the 24-hour standard. That’s the shortest day on record since we started atomic timekeeping in the 1960s.That doesn’t mean anything dangerous for Earth’s inhabitants.With enough speeding up of the Earth’s rotation, atomic timekeepers could one day add a “negative leap second,” or remove one official second from one day."

Yale’s was $42.3 billion, Stanford’s was $37.8 billion and Princeton’s was $37.7 billion. Kirk’s numbers appear to reflect 2020 endowment values.Private institutions with very large endowments, such as Harvard University, pay a 1.4% excise tax on net endowment investment income."
"“The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says with the supersized staff, the IRS audit rate ‘would rise for ALL taxpayers’ regardless of income, and would even result in audits of innocent Americans who have paid their taxes and don’t owe the IRS anything.”",half-true,"Iowa’s Republican U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst says an increase in Internal Revenue Service audits would include all taxpayers, not just those with high incomes.A Congressional Budget Office says that, but adds that the rate of increased audits for lower-income taxpayers would not match that of higher-income payers or large corporations."
"Sarasota, Florida, teachers told they cannot purchase books, accept donated reading materials, order from Scholastic or hold book fairs.",half-true,"Sarasota County Schools asked teachers to temporarily stop buying library books and accepting donated reading materials to allow Florida's Department of Education to issue guidance on how to comply with HB 1467, which heightens scrutiny on school library and instructional materials.Book fairs already slated for the fall can remain as scheduled.

"""We are number one in the country as far as our spending (COVID-19 relief) money on businesses as it relates to the percentage of federal funds that we receive.""",half-true,"Wisconsin received$2.5 billionunder the American Rescue Plan Act, known as ARPA.Of the portion that had been allocated as of March 2022, some 31.56% went to business assistance, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.That put Wisconsin at the top of the 50 states at the time.But there are caveats, including that rankings may have changed since the study was released and that the analysis Evers is relying on didn’t include other COVID relief, such as the earlier CARES Act."
"""Adam Laxalt fought an investigation into the oil industry, then they funded his campaign.""",half-true,"As Nevada’s attorney general, Republican Laxalt in 2016 opposed efforts by Democratic attorneys general to investigate whether oil companies made fraudulent disclosures about climate change. He also helped Exxon Mobil Corp. fight one of the investigations.The investigations were criticized by Republican attorneys general as chilling to free speech.A super PAC said it made $2.5 million in what are known as independent expenditures on ads to support Laxalt’s 2018 run for Nevada governor. Oil and gas was the group’s largest industry donor to the PAC during that election cycle, but the vast majority of those donations were from individuals, not organizations."
"About a federal hospital price transparency requirement, “Nobody’s enforcing that law.”",half-true,"The advertisement contends that no one is enforcing rules that require hospitals to post information about prices they’ve negotiated with insurers and the amounts they charge cash-paying customers for all their services.Many hospitals have not complied, either not posting any pricing information at all or listing only part of what is required.The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has sent nearly 370 warning notices to hospitals but has fined only two for noncompliance so far. The law went into effect in January 2021."
"A Democratic bill negotiated between Sens. Joe Manchin and Chuck Schumer would ""increase taxes on millions of Americans across every income bracket.""",half-true,"• An analysis by Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation found that every income group would lose ground from the bill’s tax changes, although by a modest amount — approximately 1%.• However, this analysis didn’t factor in subsidies for energy efficiency and clean energy, the continuation of expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, and lower drug prices because of Medicare negotiations. Independent experts expect these benefits to cancel out, or reverse, any negative tax impacts.• The only actual tax increases in the bill are levied directly on very large corporations and high-earning money managers. This means that any impact on ordinary Americans would come from secondary effects, which are difficult to measure."

Students who are in the country illegally are not eligible for financial aid or student loans."
"""We've cut the deficit by a record $1.5 trillion this year.""",half-true,"• Federal deficit projections for 2022 range from $1.5 trillion to $1.7 trillion, broadly in line with what Yellen said.• However, declaring this a record sidesteps the highly unusual circumstances that made it possible — the expiration of spending measures to combat the pandemic."

"""Thanks to failed Dem policies, beer is 9.1% more expensive.""",half-true,"Like many other products, the price of beer has steeply increased since 2020, rising just more than 10% since April 2020.Experts say there are a host of reasons that prices have risen, including the Russia invasion of Ukraine, supply chain issues and the resonating impacts of the pandemic.In other words, it can’t be solely attributed to the policies and spending under Democrats, such as the American Rescue Plan."
Mehmet Oz “wants to make abortion a crime in Pennsylvania.”,half-true,"Oz suported the overturning of Roe, which protected access to abortion nationwide. He also favors letting states set their on abortion laws.Since the Roe reversal, some states have made it a felony to perform abortions.Oz says he backs abortions only in the limited cases of rape, incest, and if the life of the woman is in danger. He has not specified what criminal penalties, if any, he would support if a woman had an unlawful abortion."
The RNC is “a $200 million economic infusion into our communities.”,half-true,"The $200 million estimate was based on numbers from the 2016 Republican National Convention hosted in Cleveland.One expert notes that the estimate is “certainly wildly exaggerated.”A comprehensive study looking into the economic impact of multiple previous political national conventions suggests that hotel revenues, for instance, increased by $20 million on average for the host cities."

“The majority of citizens in the country will have no change at all because … most of the population resides in states that have already protected abortion rights.”,half-true,"• Nearly 38% of the population lives in states that have “already protected abortion rights” by affirmatively passing laws to keep abortion legal in the absence of Roe.• Another 39% lives in states that have passed laws banning abortion and that are moving toward going into effect after the overturning of Roe.• Turley said he reached his conclusion by looking at the population in the states that are left once the states that have laws on the books banning abortion are removed from the equation. Including the states that have already acted to keep abortion legal, this leaves 61% of the population — a majority — living in a state where, for now at least, the overturning of Roe isn’t changing the legal status of abortion.• In many of the states making up this 61% majority, abortion is not actually “protected” by a law but rather by the principle that something not affirmatively banned is presumed to be legal."
"Adam Laxalt ""supports eliminating Nevada's protections for legal abortions.""",half-true,"Abortion is allowed in Nevada during the first 24 weeks without restrictions. After 24 weeks, an abortion is allowed if it is to preserve the woman’s life or health.

After that tool was repealed, Beasley and the court ruled that the man couldn't be returned to death row because that would constitute double-jeopardy.In the other case, a man convicted of assaulting a minor sought to have his case thrown out because prosecutors didn't properly identify his accuser.

Today the rate is 27 percent.”",half-true,"Title 42 was put into place in March 2020 by then-President Donald Trump to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S.The policy allows Border Patrol to send immigrants back to their home country without logging them into the immigration system in the U.S., meaning there are no repercussions to crossing the border again afterwards.While the number of re-crossings has grown, the number of people reaching the U.S.’s southern border is growing in general, thanks to natural disasters and COVID impacts in people’s home countries."
“It costs more to live in many Florida cities than New York City.”,half-true,"Only Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach had a median rent that surpassed New York City.

Tony Evers did seek to raise a net $1 billion in taxes in his most recent budget proposal, which Republicans rejected.GOP lawmakers crafted their own budget that delivered more than $2 billion in tax cuts, and Evers signed it.This came after budget estimates came in showing policymakers had an extra $4.4 billion to work with.Macco misses the mark in his comment about the higher taxes going toward heating homes. Evers did aim to increase the amount of revenue utilities would contribute to a program focused on energy efficiencies, but that’s certainly not $1 billion worth."
"""Ron Johnson pushed through a special tax loophole that benefited his own family's business … Then he cashed out of the company for $5 million … (he has) doubled his wealth since taking office.""",half-true,"In 2017, Johnson provided a key vote for former President Donald Trump’s massive tax bill on the condition it included a provision for “pass-through” entities, typically small businesses.But that wasn’t a loophole – it was done in the open, and benefitted almost 25 million businesses across the country.In 2020, Johnson sold his interest in the family-owned business for between $5 million and $25 million.Johnson’s estimated wealth increased 102.2% since taking office in 2011."
“Most Americans favor keeping Title 42 in place.”,half-true,"In a Morning Consult/Politico poll, 56% of respondents said they oppose the decision to remove the Title 42 border controls implemented by the Trump administration.Polling experts say the phrasing of Morning Consult's question wasn’t ideal because it mentioned Donald Trump and Joe Biden, preventing a clean look into what respondents think about merits of Title 42, specifically.A separate poll by a pro-immigration group found a narrow majority of Americans on the opposite side of the issue, supporting the idea of lifting Title 42."
"""For four years, I was a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania.""",half-true,"• Biden served as Benjamin Franklin Presidential Professor of the Practice at the University of Pennsylvania between his tenure as vice president and the start of his presidential campaign.• However, the duration of his position was closer to two years than it was to four, since he was on unpaid leave while running for president.• Biden’s duties did not include the same degree of teaching, research and administrative responsibilities that some may associate with the term “full professor.”"
“J.D. Vance called for higher taxes.”,half-true,Mike Gibbons is partly right that J.D. Vance called for higher taxes.Vance supports raising taxes for some corporations and corporate leaders. But he has not called for tax increases broadly.
Republicans’ “plan would cut Social Security benefits. … Average benefit cut would be 13%.”,barely-true,"A House Republican Study Committee proposal from June supports cuts to beneficiaries by setting a higher retirement age and changing benefit formulas. Experts said President Joe Biden’s 13% figure is speculative, but plausible.This is one Republican faction’s plan, not something universally adopted by the GOP, and it’s not certain to be enacted.Biden’s framing ignores that his own policy — essentially continuing the status quo — threatens bigger across-the-board reductions by the early 2030s.A group that analyzed the proposal said there is neither enough detail to say what the committee’s full plan is nor a comprehensive assessment of what the average cut would, or wouldn’t, be."

“Because of our economic policies we now are reducing inflation.”,barely-true,"Inflation has fallen since mid-2022 on President Joe Biden’s watch, and some of his policies may have helped on the margins, economists say.However, the biggest reason for the disinflationary pattern has been something the administration doesn’t control: interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.A decline in oil prices and a slowdown in China’s economy, which the administration can’t control, either, have helped, too, economists say."
“Gen Z is divided 50-50 on whether they support Hamas or Israel.”,barely-true,One Harvard-Harris poll found that among American 18-to-24 year olds — part of Generation Z — 48% said they sided with Hamas after it attacked Israel on Oct. 7. But that was based on a small subsample of 199 people.That age group also gave several other responses in the Harvard-Harris poll that seemed to contradict support for Hamas.Three other recent polls found lower Hamas support among Generation Z.

Sweden and the Netherlands allow chest surgery at age 16 and genital surgeries at 18.

Sen. Rick Scott “wants to … end Social Security and Medicare coverage.”,barely-true,"Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott in 2022 proposed a broad plan calling for sunsetting all federal laws after five years and requiring Congress to renew the ones it wants to keep. The provision didn’t mention Social Security and Medicare, but both programs were created through federal legislation and would’ve been looped in under the wording.After criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, Scott revised the plan about a year later to exclude the programs.Scott’s original plan wouldn’t have ended Social Security or Medicare outright, but would have made it possible for the programs to stop if Congress periodically voted against renewing them — something experts said would be possible, given the difficulty of passing expansive packages."

This was largely before Pence entered Congress, and half a decade to a decade before the law he referred to passed.The annual deficit, which is not the same as the debt, declined in 2006 and 2007, but those were not the most recent deficit declines.

California’s Proposition 1 includes “a right to abortion up-to-birth.”,barely-true,"If passed by voters, the constitutional amendment would not change existing state laws, which already outline when abortions can be performed.Under current California law, abortion is legal until viability, which is when a fetus can survive outside the womb. That occurs around 24 to 26 weeks of pregnancy. After that, an abortion is allowed only if the mother’s life or health are in danger.If passed, Proposition 1 could be challenged in court, but experts say it’s unlikely that courts would rule to remove limits on abortion."
The U.S. “could easily count every vote in every state on election night until a few years ago.”,barely-true,"•We found several examples of races in recent history that took days, weeks or months to determine a winner. The 2020 U.S. presidential election is one prominent example.•Decades ago, news outlets could more quickly project election winners based on unofficial results, because most voting was done in person on Election Day and in many places, machines could count the vote quickly.•In recent years, voting by mail has become increasingly popular. Because mail ballots require extra handling, counting them can take longer. And varying state laws about when counting can begin can cause differences in timing from state to state."

Only Democratic cities take “‘days’ to count their votes” while “the rest of the country manages to get it done on election night.”,barely-true,"In the 2020 general election, results lagged in some pivotal and closely watched cities, including Detroit, Atlanta, and Milwaukee. Other big cities outpaced their states in vote-counting in 2020, including some of the biggest jurisdictions in Texas, Florida and Arizona.It will inevitably take longer for high-population cities to count their ballots quickly than small-population rural areas will, meaning that simple math is at least as big a factor as partisan control.Cities operate under ballot-handling parameters set by their states, which in many cases have been set by Republicans who occupy state-level offices."

Val Demings voted for in the U.S. House. However, the law levies tax increases directly on very large corporations and high earners.​​It is difficult to measure the indirect impact of how those hikes will be passed on to ordinary Americans. Experts said comments like Rubio’s ignore the benefits of subsidies for taxpayers included in the law."
"“More than half of the $739 billion tax increase (in the Inflation Reduction Act) will go to wasteful Green New Deal programs like tree equity, 'clean' garbage trucks, and studying cow farts.""",barely-true,"• Calling the $739 billion figure a tax increase is exaggerated. Not counting federal health care savings that are counted as revenue for budgetary purposes, the scale of the tax increase is about $457 billion.• The bill’s environmental provisions do add up to $391 billion, or more than half of $739 billion. However, the amount spent on trees, clean trucks and cattle emissions account for a tiny fraction of that, somewhere between half of 1% and 1.4%."

“Every single Senate Democrat voted against hiring more border agents. They voted against deporting felons. And they voted against ending catch and release.”,barely-true,The ad uses votes only from a budget reconciliation “vote-a-rama” on amendments as proof of Senate Democrats immigration stances.Senate Democrats voted in favor of a spending bill that increased funding for Border Patrol hiring and resources to detain and deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally who have been convicted of crimes.Democrats’ vote against funding to keep an immigration public health policy in place did not keep border agents from releasing immigrants into the U.S. because of a lack of detention space.
"Mark Kelly ""voted to allow prison inmates to receive stimulus checks five separate times.""",barely-true,"There have been three laws passed in response to the coronavirus pandemic, two signed by then-President Donald Trump and one by President Joe Biden, that provided stimulus checks to millions of Americans. Prison inmates were eligible for all of the payments.One law was signed before Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., took office. Kelly voted in favor of the other two and against a failed amendment to one bill that would have excluded inmates from receiving a stimulus payment. That amendment was the only vote specifically about inmates receiving stimulus checks.Republicans supported the first two bills signed by Trump, then denounced the Biden bill. Republicans criticized the Biden stimulus payment for going to incarcerated people, even though the previous ones went to them, too."

“Mandela Barnes came out in favor of abortion up until the moment of birth.”,barely-true,"The National Republican Senatorial Committee’s backup for the claim relies heavily on Barnes’ comments about codifying Roe v. Wade — not abortion up until the moment of birth.For his part, Barnes had not been entirely clear on his position on this question — until we pushed his campaign to be more precise.In any case, there has not been any recent change, as the claim suggests, much less one with this level of specificity."

A traditional battery simply starts the car engine, while the battery for an electric vehicle stores all the power needed for moving the vehicle.Early studies have found that over a car’s lifetime, consumers save money with electric vehicles because of lower fuel and maintenance costs."
"In Texas, a person can register a dead relative to vote and then cast a mail ballot in their name.",barely-true,"When Texans submit a voter registration application, their name, birth date, driver’s license number or four digits of their Social Security number are compared with records from the Texas Department of Public Safety and Social Security Administration. That process would flag an application on a dead person’s behalf.The Texas secretary of state receives information regarding people who have died weekly, or monthly, depending upon the data. That information is immediately forwarded to county voter registrars so that they can remove those individuals from their voter rolls.County officials remove thousands of dead people from the voter rolls each month."
Says “Tim Michels wants to defund public education — calling it ‘the definition of insanity’ to continue to fund public schools.”,barely-true,"At a July 2022 primary debate, Michels said it was the “definition of insanity” to continually increase funding to public schools without better results. The campaign’s quote makes it seem as though he said it was insane to continue funding them at all, which is wrong.However, as a proponent of school choice expansion, Michels could oversee changes that result in cuts to public education.School vouchers are already funded by cutting state aid to school districts. If Michels increases the number of students who use vouchers and doesn’t otherwise increase funding to public education, that will cut funding for public schools — unless he chooses to fund the expansion in another way."

He made similar comments in 2009 and 2022. Fetterman’s campaign told PolitiFact the tattoos have nothing to do with heroin use and are not an homage to any gang.Fetterman used to have a tattoo on the outside of his right wrist that read, “I will make you hurt.” It’s a lyric from a popular song that refers to needle use. But in a 2009 interview, Fetterman connected that sentiment with the deaths recorded on the other side of his arm."
"Lee County, Florida, wasn't ""even in the cone"" of Hurricane Ian 72 hours before landfall.",barely-true,"Most of Lee County, Florida, was not within the forecast cone of Hurricane Ian 72 hours before landfall. But one of the county's barrier islands, Cayo Costa, appeared inside the forecast cone on each of the eight advisories issued by the National Hurricane Center on Sept. 25, three days before the storm.The forecast cone visual is meant to show the probable track of the center of the storm, not the extent of a hurricane's reach. Focusing on the forecast cone downplays the impacts of a storm as large as Ian, said Matt Rogers, an atmospheric science researcher at Colorado State University.Still, in Ian's case, the cone was an accurate forecast of the storm's eventual trajectory, Rogers said. The hurricane ultimately made landfall in Cayo Costa."
